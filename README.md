## What is synthetic data?

Synthetic data refers to artificially generated data that usually aims to mimic real-world data. This data is created algorithmically, often using models or simulations, rather than being collected from real-world sources. Synthetic data has been used for a long time in machine learning, particularly for domains where real data is scarce or expensive to collect. It is also used to augment real data to improve model performance or to protect privacy by generating data that is similar to real data but does not contain sensitive information. This repository is focused primarily on synthetic data generated via the use of large language models (LLMs).

## Synthetic data generation from and for LLMs and vLLMs

Synthetic data is increasingly being created via LLMs.

## Important Datasets

### [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories)

> TinyStories, a synthetic dataset of short stories that only contain words that a typical 3 to 4-year-olds usually understand, generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We show that TinyStories can be used to train and evaluate LMs that are much smaller than the state-of-the-art models (below 10 million total parameters), or have much simpler architectures (with only one transformer block), yet still produce fluent and consistent stories with several paragraphs that are diverse and have almost perfect grammar, and demonstrate reasoning capabilities.
