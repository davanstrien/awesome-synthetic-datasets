## What is synthetic data?

Synthetic data, in the context of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning, refers to artificially generated data that mimics real-world data. This data is created algorithmically, often using generative models or simulations, rather than being collected from real-world sources.

## Important Datasets

### [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories)

> TinyStories, a synthetic dataset of short stories that only contain words that a typical 3 to 4-year-olds usually understand, generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We show that TinyStories can be used to train and evaluate LMs that are much smaller than the state-of-the-art models (below 10 million total parameters), or have much simpler architectures (with only one transformer block), yet still produce fluent and consistent stories with several paragraphs that are diverse and have almost perfect grammar, and demonstrate reasoning capabilities.
